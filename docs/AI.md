# Rules and Guidelines for AI Assistants and Agents

### Code Structure and Organization

**Modularity**:
* Keep files small and modular.
* No file must exceed 400 lines of code**.
* If a file becomes too large, refactor by breaking down classes or functions into smaller modules.

**Component Management**:

* Split large components into smaller, manageable parts to enhance readability and maintainability.

**Dependencies**:

* Limit the use of dependencies when possible.

**Separation of Concerns**:

* Move constants, configurations, and lengthy strings to separate files or configuration modules.

**Naming Conventions**:

* Use descriptive and meaningful names for files, functions, and variables to improve code clarity.

**Documentation**:

* Document all file dependencies.
* Maintain a clean and organized project structure with clear directories and file hierarchies.
* Ensure the readme.md, docs/DESIGN.md and docs/USAGES.md stay up to date
